  - title: 'JavaScript and TypeScript everywhere'
    extract: |
      JS runs in the browser, JS runs on the server, JS even run on physical devices sometimes. What if we told you that we started to run JS in other applications?
      In this talk we (Jb Aviat, Sqreen CTO and V. de Turckheim) will show you how we use JavaScript (I mean TypeScript) to enhence the behavior of applications written in diverse languages (Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, ...). We will also talk about the issues we met when embedding a JS engine into other apps and what alternatives we looked at (SPOILER ALERT: THERE WILL BE WebAssembly).
