  - title: 'Gatsby - How is it different from other static site generator?'
    extract: |
      Gatsby.js is one of the most popular and hype static website generator of the moment. Having built my latest project with it and having a long experience with this kind of technology, I want to answer two questions with this talk:
      - how is it different from other generators?
      - is it the right tool for you?

      This talk is about the importance of art and play in Node, about the abilities Node has gained in its ten years as a project. There's a musical number and a discussion of MIDI as a way to send data. Let's dive into the ways Node can be used that we don't always think about.
